## Introduction

[App Auto-Patch 3](https://github.com/App-Auto-Patch/App-Auto-Patch/) integrates local application discovery, [Installomator](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator/wiki), and user-friendly [swiftDialog](https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog/wiki) prompts to automate application patch management for Mac computers.

With version 3, automation has been elevated with the introduction of several new features, including an automated background agent, settings via a configuration profile and enhanced deferral options.
